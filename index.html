      <h4 class="text" description: China has run out of trees>
        China has been thriving in the economy in the past few years.<br />
        But ever since the carbon emissions in China have increased,<br />
        many trees have been dying. Almost 4.5 billion trees have died<br />
        in China, and the tree population is still decreasing rapidly. A
        researcher<br />
        at The University of China has reported, "After exploring China, we
        have<br />
        realized that only 800 trees are remaining in the country." (Randy
        Jones). <br />People will have to leave China because there won't be
        enough trees, <br />said a reporter from CNN. Many residents of China
        have had to migrate to<br />
        another country forcefully by the government but were given
        compensation<br />
        to upwards of 50 thousand U.S. dollars. A former Chinese citizen<br />
        was interviewed and stated that he was, "Angry when I was given a
        notice<br />
        by government officials saying that he had to move to a different
        place."

      <h4 class="text" description: Farting is banned in florida>You can't fart in public in Florida. After a child farted<br> in front of David Samson, the whole of Florida was in shock.<br> The fart smelled so bad that David couldn't breathe and <br>had to get away from the child. After some searching,<br> government officials found the child who did this crime.<br> Ever since then, farting has been banned in public in Florida.<br> If you fart in public, you could be sentenced to community<br> service for a month or even be arrested if the fart induces<br> agony. Thousands of people don't know about this rule<br> in Florida and are in danger. If things go wrong and they fart,<br> it could be over.</h4>
